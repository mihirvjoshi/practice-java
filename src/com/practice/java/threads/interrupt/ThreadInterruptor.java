/**
 * 
 * Make a task that prints 0 through 9 on console.
 * After printing a number the task should wait 1 sec before printing the next number.
 * The task runs on a separate thread, other than main application thread.
 * After starting the task the main application should wait for 3 sec and then shutdown.
 * On shutdown the application should request the running task to finish.
 * Before shutting down completely the application should, at the max, wait for 1 sec for the task to finish.
 * The task should respond to the finish request by stopping immediately.

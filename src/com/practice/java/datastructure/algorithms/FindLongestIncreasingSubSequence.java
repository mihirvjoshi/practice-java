/**
 * Given a sequence, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence from a given sequence .
 * The longest increasing subsequence means to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which 
 * the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. 
 * This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
 * Note: Duplicate numbers are not counted as increasing subsequence.
 * For example:
 * length of LIS for
 * { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.

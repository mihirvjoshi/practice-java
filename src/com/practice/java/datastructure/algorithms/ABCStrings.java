	 * Given an integer N,Find how many strings of length N are possible, consisting only of characters { 'A','B' and 'C' } 
	 * with each character {'A','B' and 'C'} occurs at least once.

		Input:
		First line of each test case contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains a single integer N.
		
		Output:
		For each test case print the expected output. Output may be too large so print it modulo 109+7.
		
		Constraints:
		1<=T<=105
		1<=N<=109
